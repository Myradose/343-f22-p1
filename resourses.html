          <h2 id="supplementary">Supplementary Genki Materials</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Realkana
            <ul>
              <li>THIS IS REQUIRED.</li>
              <li>I highly recommend working through all of hiragana and katakana until you can select all hiragana and katakana and get all of them right without thinking about it. Even if you know all of them, it makes learning much much easier if you never get hung up on certain kana since that breaks the flow of whatever you are reading. I recommend working through this every day but you can change how often if needed.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Interactive kana charts: hiragana, katakana</li>
            <li>Official Genki audio
            <ul>
              <li>This is all of the audio files for Genki 1 and Genki 2. It helps to imitate these sound files and to know how a native speaker would say things. You can also access the Genki audio using a free app called OTO Navi: Android, IOS.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ringotan (android app)
            <ul>
              <li>This is an amazing android app that can teach you how to write hiragana, katakana, and the Genki kanji in proper stroke order. It also uses SRS similar to Anki to facilitate everything you learn into your long term memory. If you don’t have an android device but you have a touchscreen laptop or drawing tablet, you can get an android emulator on your laptop to still use this app. It will eventually be a paid app but is completely free forever for anyone who downloads it now while it’s still in development. It is also planned to release to IOS in the future.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Kanji alive
            <ul>
              <li>This tool allows you to learn everything you need to know about lesson kanji. You can use advanced search parameters to show Genki lesson kanji. For example, if you want lesson 3 kanji, search “text:gen:c3” without quotes. If you want lesson 4 kanji, search for “text:gen:c4” without quotes, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Online Genki practice and exercises
            <ul>
              <li>This website has exercises for every single lesson and is a great way to test your comprehension of the material.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Genki conversation comprehension practice
            <ul>
              <li>This website has audio that uses concepts from each lesson and quizzes you based on your understanding of the material. It also has a slowed down version of each conversation.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Quizlets for every lesson (click on the links in the chart down below)
            <ul>
              <li>I’m scared to even mention this, but I think it is a useful tool for progressing within the Anki decks, not a substitute. Do not, I repeat DO NOT use this as a replacement for the vocabulary and kanji Anki decks. Use this for isolated review of related/similar terms. Ex. days of the week. The conjugation quizlets are good for studying since that is not covered in the anki decks.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Genki conjugation practice
            <ul>
              <li>These exercises practice conjugation of what is learned in each lesson.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Official Genki workbooks
            <ul>
              <li>The Genki workbooks have additional practice for the concepts learned in each lesson. You can get them as a physical or digital copy or get them as a sneaky pirate through the libgen website I mentioned earlier.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New official Genki self-study page (3rd edition)</li>
            <li>Old official Genki self-study page (2nd edition but still has useful resources)</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="additional">Additional Related Materials</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Capture2Text
            <ul>
              <li>Software that allows you to copy Japanese characters/sentences from a snippet of your screen. Very useful if you want to look up kanji in the Genki textbook pdfs.</li>
              <li>I highly recommend downloading this Google Font to use with this program since the default one isn’t very pretty.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Patreon course for learning Japanese phonetics
            <ul>
              <li>It may be helpful to go through the free videos in his course. I wouldn’t recommend worrying about the rest right away. I haven’t started this yet, but it is a very well received course. It helps you sound like a native.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Random conjugation practice
            <ul>
              <li>This site allows you to practice random conjugation with lots of customizable settings.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Write It! Japanese: IOS, Android
            <ul>
              <li>This is the app I originally used before finding Ringotan. The plus side is that it is on IOS and android. The downside is that it only teaches you how to write hiragana and katakana, (no kanji) has ads, and some features are locked unless you buy the full version. I will say that writing is much more natural on this app than Ringotan.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Kana - Hiragana and Katakana (IOS)
            <ul>
              <li>Really good IOS app for learning and writing hiragana and katakana.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

            <li>Animelon
            <ul>
              <li>An absolutely FANTASTIC way of learning Japanese through watching anime. It allows you to display multiple subtitles including hiragana, katakana, japanese, romaji, and english. While the episode is playing, you can hover over any words you don’t understand and it will provide the definition. You can even loop sections of dialogue and slow them down.</li>

            </li>
            <li>Crystal Hunters
            <ul>
              <li>This is a manga designed for teaching Japanese. When trying to find easy resources to learn Japanese, usually you have to end up reading boring children’s books when starting out, but this is an actual adventure exploration style manga written with very basic Japanese grammatical concepts. There are several books and each one incorporates new Japanese grammar and vocabulary and has a corresponding reading guide to learn the material. The first book can be found for free here and the corresponding reading guide can be found here.</li>
