                <h1>Ultimate Self-Study Japanese Learning Guide</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>Getting ready</h2>
            <p>To start your Japanese journey, there are a few resources that are absolutely necessary.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Genki 1 textbook (digital or physical)</li>
                <li>A laptop and/or smartphone</li>
                <li><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.wanikani.com/">WaniKani subscription</a></li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <p>Some of the really valuable resources are only available for android but if you have a Windows 11 laptop, there's no need to worry! If you have Windows 11, you can try using Windows Subsystem for Android to get android apps on windows. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-run-android-apps-on-any-windows-11-pc/">This article might be helpful.</a> Here’s a tool that might be helpful for sideloading android apps: <a href="https://github.com/alesimula/wsa_pacman">WSA PacMan</a>. You can download android app APK files <a href="https://apkpure.com/">here</a>.</p> -->
            <!-- <img src="./images/anki.png" class="float-right" alt="Anki"> -->
            <!-- <p>Don't worry too much about configuring Anki here, just make sure it's installed. You can download Anki for desktop here and it is also available as a paid IOS app here.</p> -->
            <p>If you can't afford/don't want to pay for a WaniKani subscription, you can still progress through this guide since it is uncorrelated with the genki curriculum. That being said, I <b>HIGHLY reccomend</b> getting a WaniKani subscription if you can and I think it is important enough to be considered a "requirement".</p>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <h4 style="width: 0; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">heading 4 lol</h4>
            <p>Once you've gotten the required resources, it's time to set everything up! First things first, choose a video path.</p>
            <p>It is <b>REQUIRED</b> to choose at least one of these unless you are a very textual learner. If you choose not to use these you must at least listen to the Genki audio instead so you know how to correctly pronounce things.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Official Genki grammar videos</h5>
                  <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Option 1</h6>
                  <p class="card-text">This is my favorite supplemental learning resource for grammar. Unfortunately, this is one of the few resources that I don’t think you can get around paying for. It goes over every grammar point covered in every lesson and asks for you to repeat what she says in Japanese and answer questions in Japanese. It also has quizzes that test your knowledge.</p>

                  <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Option 2</h6>
                  <p class="card-text">I would consider this the second best and free alternative to the official series above. It goes over every grammar point, but may not explicitly ask you to repeat stuff she says or answer questions. Think of the official one as teaching plus facilitation videos and this one as just teaching videos.</p>

                  <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Option 3</h6>
                  <p class="card-text">This is the most visual way of learning Genki concepts. Similar to the resources above, it teaches all of the grammatical concepts. Unlike the resources above, it is more loosely structured. As in, instead of having one specific video for each grammar point in a lesson, it introduces them more naturally and will cover all topics in a lesson before you finish it. This is more similar to a real classroom setting but may take longer than the other recommended videos above. If you are a very visual learner I would recommend this series and use one of the above resources if you want to review something specific. This is a very new series so it does not cover all of Genki 1 and none of Genki 2 as of writing this however, the creator is actively making new videos.</p>

            <h3>Anki</h3>
            <p>Now we need to setup Anki.</p>
            <p>If you don’t know what Anki is, it is a flashcard software designed to ingrain all learned vocabulary/flashcards into long term memory. It does this using SRS. (spaced repetition software) This basically means that stuff you know will be shown less and stuff you don’t know will be shown more. I HIGHLY recommend you do your daily cards for whatever decks you choose every day. Unless you are doing many decks at once this should only take you max 30-60 minutes. If you find it is taking longer or you can’t allocate 30-60 minutes out of your day, adjust the settings so that you are shown fewer new cards each day.</p>
            <p>There are two decks that we will use in this guide.</p>

            <!-- <p>While not required, if you plan on doing writing practice, I highly recommend getting <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ringotan&hl=en_US&gl=US">Ringotan</a>. It is an Android only app, but there is a way to get it on Windows 11. If you don't have a Windows 11 computer and you don't have an android, I don't have a subsitute app at this time.</p>
            <p>This is an amazing android app that can teach you how to write hiragana, katakana, and the Genki kanji in proper stroke order. It also uses SRS similar to Anki to facilitate everything you learn into your long term memory.  It will eventually be a paid app but is completely free forever for anyone who downloads it now while it’s still in development. It is also planned to release to IOS in the future.</p>
            <p>If you have an android phone, you can download the app on the app store and skip the steps below.</p> -->
